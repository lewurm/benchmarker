# The Benchmarker Front-end

## Motivation

The goal of the benchmarker front-end is to provide a convenient way to view and compare the results of running benchmarks. We use the following terminology to talk about benchmark results:

 * A **run** is a single execution of a single benchmark.

 * A **machine** is the identity of a machine on which benchmarks can be run.

 * A **config** is the set of command-line arguments and environment variables with which benchmarks can be run.

 * A **run set** is a set of results from running all benchmarks at a particular commit, on a particular machine, with a particular config.

Notably, benchmark results are not generally comparable between machines or configs, unless trying to identify platform- or architecture-specific regressions.

Common tasks include:

 * Automatically recording benchmark results for pushes to interesting repositories (e.g., Mono) in order to locate regressions (and improvements!).

 * Comparing run sets from different commits in order to identify the causes of regressions.

## Architecture

The front-end is built using [React]. Charts are rendered using [amCharts]. ES6 sources are compiled with [webpack] and type-checked with [flow] (using `make flow`).

Each page has a basic skeleton HTML document `page.html`, a page-specific stylesheet `src/page.css`, and a controller/renderer script `src/page.js`.

A pageâ€™s module has two classes: a `Controller` that derives from the `Controller` class in `common.js`, and a `Page` that derives from `React.Component`. The `Controller` is the entry point of the page, responsible for loading data at startup and invoking React to render the `Page`, while the `Page` is the top-level layout and state of the view.

Each module registers a callback with the `start` function from `common.js`, which creates a `Controller` instance and invokes its `loadAsync` method to begin loading initial data.
